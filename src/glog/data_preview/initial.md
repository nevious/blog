So... Here we are. Gotta say, the description sounds a tad bit depressing, but this is 2026. I started this blog just to learn some [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and I honestly don't quite remember why, still; it's been fun! And yes, I am painfully aware of how unimpressive it is but I enjoy it nonetheless. Hours spent in enjoyment are not wasted, even if it's about reinventing the wheel for the `nth` time. Who would've thought that this old Linux guy might find joy in doing JavaScript? Things change and shift I guess. Not all for the better, but not everything has gone to shits _yet_.

## So what to expect

Let's consider it a diary of sorts. I plan to document some hikes out in the Swiss mountains as well as some techie things if the muse strikes me. Perhaps there will be some things that I consider inspiring and would therefore want to share. Perhaps some artsy stuff but most likely there will be some random rambling and ranting about everyday things. I guess you have been warned &#128518; Books! Books are cool, remember them?!

I'll figure it out &#128513;

Surely a "good boy" tax is in order.

Let me assure you, he _is_ the goodest of all the boys among so many other goodest of all the boys. A friend missed is a friend never dead. We must never forget them and we must remember, that we don't deserve them in the first place.
